    "Welcome to Machine Learning at Scale! This first homework assignment introduces one of the core strategies in distributed processing: divide and conquer. We'll use the simplest of tasks, word counting, to illustrate the difference between a scalable and non-scalable algorithm. You will be working with the text of _Alice in Wonderland_ to put these ideas into practice using Python and Bash scripting. By the end of this week you should be able to:\n",
    "* ... __describe__ the Bias-Variance tradeoff as it applies to Machine Learning.\n",
    "* ... __explain__ why we consider word counting to be an \"Embarrassingly Parallel\" task.\n",
    "* ... __estimate__ the runtime of embarrassingly parallel tasks using \"back of the envelope\" calculations.\n",
    "* ... __implement__ a Map Reduce algorithm using the Command Line.\n",
    "* ... __set-up__ a Docker container and know why we use them for this course.\n",

For example, you might choose to remove punctuation or to consider punctuation symbols  'tokens' in their own right. __In this question you'll use the Python `re` module to create a tokenizer to use when you perform WordCount on the _Alice In Wonderland_ text.__\n",

From my understanding, this algorithm was chosen because it is the most efficient in the map-and-reduce process as both MapReduce and merge-sort use divide-and-conquer strategy. The input file is divided into a dictionary of key-value pairs in the Map phase. During the shuffling phase, the keys are sorted. Finally in the Reduce phase, the sorted keys can be merged and each reducer sums the counts of each word and emits a single key-value pair with the word and sum."

The bash script itself served as our '_framework_' -- it split up the original input, then ___mapped___ our word counting script on to each chunk, then ___aggregated (a.k.a. reduced)___ the resulting files by piping them into our collation script.  Unfortunately, as you may have realized already, there is a major scalability concern with this particular implementation. __In this question you'll fix our implementation of parallel word count so that it will be scalable.__\n",

If the vocabulary is too large to fit on a single computer, we might split the word counts in half after sorting them, then perform the reducing on two separate machines. Explain what could go wrong with this approach.

Then the \"hatter\" lines are separated to two machines, and won't be reduced. When the reduced results are combined, the \"hatter\" lines will remain and won't be reduced to [..., hatter 10, ...]\n",

If they are the same, we move the split point forward by one step at a time and check if the next word is the same. We stop moving the split point until the next is a new word, and thus ensure that one word group won't be separated to different reducers. This way would eliminate the duplicate after combining the reduced results."

    "> __a)__ Lin and Dyer consider data and resources as the two features of an \"ideal algorithm\" from a scalability perspective. Data - Given twice the amount of data, the same algorithm should take at most twice as long to run, all else being equal. Resources - Given a cluster twice the size, the same algorithm should take no more than half as long to run.\n",
    "\n",
    "> __b)__ Given that the number of partitions increases, the algorithm takes slightly more than half as long to run. The algorithm with 1 partition takes 4.44s +/- 2.86ms per loop, the one with 2 partitions takes 2.29s +/- 1.56ms, and the one with 4 partitions takes 1.23s +/- 4.25ms. Therefore, it does not meet the second criterion suggested by Lin and Dyer.\n",
    "\n",
    "> __c)__ The running times for 1, 2 and 4 partitions are similar. As the number of partitions increases to beyond 4, the algorithm takes longer time to run. This does not match my expectation as I expect the running time should go down by half as the number of partitions increases. We are seeing this due to the limitations from our implementation and the machine. The limitation from our implementations is that only one reducer is working to reduce the vocabulary for mapped results delivered from all partitions. As number of partitions gets large, it takes a longer time to reduce (e.g with 32 partitions, there could be 32 \"alice\" lines needed to be reduced to 1). The time increase in the reduce stage offset the time that has saved from partitioning in the map stage, and eventually dominate the total running time (e.g. in 16 and 32 partitions). Another limitation could be due to the number of vCPUs. There are only 4 vCPUs, so having more than 4 partitions may not be ideal.\n",
    "    The conclusion we can draw here is that our implementation does not meet the seamless scalability characteristic of an ideal algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "> __d)__ Both map and reduce components are affected by a change in the number of partition. As the number of partitions increases, the time spent on the map component decreases while the time spent on the reduce component increases. As I explained in part c), when the number of partitions gets too large, the time increase in the reduce component becomes the dominate force, eventually driving the total time up. We need to find a sweetspot on a number of partitions which the time saved in the map stage is greater than the time increased in the reduce stage, hence decreasing the total running time."

    "> __a)__ In the context of our word counting analysis, \"Embarrassingly Parallel\" refers to the problem where little effort was done to separate the data into a number of parallel tasks. There was no dependency between the parallel tasks. The mapper and reducer run in isolation without any mechanisms for direct communitation. There is only one place for cluster-wide synchronization - the concatenation and sort stage for the intermediate key-value pairs before pushing them to a reducer.\n",
    "    This term describes a problem in the implementation of a task.\n",
    "\n",
    "> __b)__ In an \"embarrasingly parallel\" workload, the data are divided into groups and the map and reduce functions can be applied in parallel to each of the groups since the two functions are associative operations. If the reducer is also commutative, it can be directly used as a combiner to combine results from parallel tasks. "
