âI have answered three questions, and that is enough,â
âI havenât the least idea what youâre talking about,â said Alice.
âI havenât the slightest idea,â said the Hatter.

âNo, please go on!â Alice said very humbly; âI wonât interrupt again. I
âNo,â said the Caterpillar.
âNobody asked _your_ opinion,â said Alice.

âTell us a story!â said the March Hare.
âThat depends a good deal on where you want to get to,â said the Cat.
âThat is not said right,â said the Caterpillar.
âThat would be grand, certainly,â said Alice thoughtfully: âbut thenâI

âThen the Dormouse shall!â they both cried. âWake up, Dormouse!â And
âThen you keep moving round, I suppose?â said Alice.
âThen you should say what you mean,â the March Hare went on.
âThere isnât any,â said the March Hare.
âThere might be some sense in your knocking,â the Footman went on
âThereâs certainly too much pepper in that soup!â Alice said to

âWhat _can_ all that green stuff be?â said Alice. âAnd where _have_ my
âWhat did they draw?â said Alice, quite forgetting her promise.
âWhat did they live on?â said Alice, who always took a great interest
âWhat do you mean by that?â said the Caterpillar sternly. âExplain
âWhat size do you want to be?â it asked.
âWhich is just the case with _mine_,â said the Hatter.
âWhich would _not_ be an advantage,â said Alice, who felt very glad to
âWho are _you?_â said the Caterpillar.
âWhoever lives there,â thought Alice, âitâll never do to come upon them
âWhoâs making personal remarks now?â the Hatter asked triumphantly.
âWhy not?â said the March Hare.
âWhy should it?â muttered the Hatter. âDoes _your_ watch tell you what
âWhy with an M?â said Alice.
âWhy?â said the Caterpillar.
âWould you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?â
âWow! wow! wow!â
âWow! wow! wow!â
âYes, but some crumbs must have got in as well,â the Hatter grumbled:
âYes, please do!â pleaded Alice.
âYes, thatâs it,â said the Hatter with a sigh: âitâs always tea-time,

âIt must be a very pretty dance,â said Alice timidly.
âItâs a friend of mineâa Cheshire Cat,â said Alice: âallow me to
âItâs a mineral, I _think_,â said Alice.
âItâs all about as curious as it can be,â said the Gryphon.
âItâs the first position in dancing.â Alice said; but was dreadfully
âItâs the thing Mock Turtle Soup is made from,â said the Queen.
âItâsâitâs a very fine day!â said a timid voice at her side. She was
âIâd rather not,â the Cat remarked.
âIâll fetch the executioner myself,â said the King eagerly, and he
âIâll tell it her,â said the Mock Turtle in a deep, hollow tone: âsit
âIâve a right to think,â said Alice sharply, for she was beginning to
âJust about as much right,â said the Duchess, âas pigs have to fly; and
âLeave off that!â screamed the Queen. âYou make me giddy.â And then,
âLetâs go on with the game,â the Queen said to Alice; and Alice was too
âMay it please your Majesty,â said Two, in a very humble tone, going
âMy name is Alice, so please your Majesty,â said Alice very politely;
âNo, I didnât,â said Alice: âI donât think itâs at all a pity. I said
âNo, indeed,â said Alice. âWhat sort of a dance is it?â
âNo, no! The adventures first,â said the Gryphon in an impatient tone:
âNo,â said Alice. âI donât even know what a Mock Turtle is.â
âNonsense!â said Alice, very loudly and decidedly, and the Queen was
âNot at all,â said Alice: âsheâs so extremelyââ Just then she noticed
âNow, I give you fair warning,â shouted the Queen, stamping on the
âOf course it is,â said the Duchess, who seemed ready to agree to
âOf course it was,â said the Mock Turtle.
âOf course not,â said the Mock Turtle: âwhy, if a fish came to _me_,
âOf course,â the Mock Turtle said: âadvance twice, set to partnersââ
âOff with their heads!â and the procession moved on, three of the
âOh, I know!â exclaimed Alice, who had not attended to this last
âOh, _you_ sing,â said the Gryphon. âIâve forgotten the words.â
âOh, a song, please, if the Mock Turtle would be so kind,â Alice
âOh, as to the whiting,â said the Mock Turtle, âtheyâyouâve seen them,
âOh, donât talk about trouble!â said the Duchess. âI make you a present
âOnce,â said the Mock Turtle at last, with a deep sigh, âI was a real
âOnly mustard isnât a bird,â Alice remarked.
âPerhaps it hasnât one,â Alice ventured to remark.
âPray donât trouble yourself to say it any longer than that,â said
âReally, now you ask me,â said Alice, very much confused, âI donât
âReeling and Writhing, of course, to begin with,â the Mock Turtle
âRight, as usual,â said the Duchess: âwhat a clear way you have of

âShe boxed the Queenâs earsââ the Rabbit began. Alice gave a little
âShe canât explain it,â said the Gryphon hastily. âGo on with the next
âSheâs in prison,â the Queen said to the executioner: âfetch her here.â
âSo he did, so he did,â said the Gryphon, sighing in his turn; and both
âSoles and eels, of course,â the Gryphon replied rather impatiently:
âSomebody said,â Alice whispered, âthat itâs done by everybody minding
âStand up and repeat ââ_Tis the voice of the sluggard_,ââ said the
âSwim after them!â screamed the Gryphon.
âTen hours the first day,â said the Mock Turtle: ânine the next, and so
âThank you, itâs a very interesting dance to watch,â said Alice,
âThank you,â said Alice, âitâs very interesting. I never knew so much
âThatâs different from what _I_ used to say when I was a child,â said
âThatâs enough about lessons,â the Gryphon interrupted in a very
âThatâs none of _your_ business, Two!â said Seven.
âThatâs nothing to what I could say if I chose,â the Duchess replied,
âThatâs right!â shouted the Queen. âCan you play croquet?â
âThatâs the reason theyâre called lessons,â the Gryphon remarked:
âThe gameâs going on rather better now,â she said, by way of keeping up
âThe lobsters!â shouted the Gryphon, with a bound into the air.
âThe reason is,â said the Gryphon, âthat they _would_ go with the
âTheir heads are gone, if it please your Majesty!â the soldiers shouted
âThen you shouldnât talk,â said the Hatter.
âThen, you know,â the Mock Turtle went on, âyou throw theââ
âThere is another shore, you know, upon the other side.
âThereâs a porpoise close behind us, and heâs treading on my tail.
âThey were obliged to have him with them,â the Mock Turtle said: âno
âThinking again?â the Duchess asked, with another dig of her sharp
âThis here young lady,â said the Gryphon, âshe wants for to know your

âTut, tut, child!â said the Duchess. âEverythingâs got a moral, if only
âTwo lines!â cried the Mock Turtle. âSeals, turtles, salmon, and so on;
âVery much indeed,â said Alice.
âVery true,â said the Duchess: âflamingoes and mustard both bite. And
âVery,â said Alice: ââwhereâs the Duchess?â
âWe called him Tortoise because he taught us,â said the Mock Turtle
âWe had the best of educationsâin fact, we went to school every dayââ
âWell, I canât show it you myself,â the Mock Turtle said: âIâm too
âWell, I never heard it before,â said the Mock Turtle; âbut it sounds
âWell, it must be removed,â said the King very decidedly, and he called
âWell, then,â the Gryphon went on, âif you donât know what to uglify
âWell, there was Mystery,â the Mock Turtle replied, counting off the
âWhat _is_ the fun?â said Alice.
âWhat _is_ the use of repeating all that stuff,â the Mock Turtle
âWhat a curious plan!â exclaimed Alice.
âWhat for?â said Alice.
âWhat for?â said the one who had spoken first.
âWhat matters it how far we go?â his scaly friend replied.
âWhat was _that_ like?â said Alice.
âWhat was that?â inquired Alice.
âWhen _Iâm_ a Duchess,â she said to herself, (not in a very hopeful
âWhen we were little,â the Mock Turtle went on at last, more calmly,
âWho _are_ you talking to?â said the King, going up to Alice, and
âWhy did you call him Tortoise, if he wasnât one?â Alice asked.
âWhy, _she_,â said the Gryphon. âItâs all her fancy, that: they never

âWith extras?â asked the Mock Turtle a little anxiously.
âWould you like to see a little of it?â said the Mock Turtle.
âWould you tell me,â said Alice, a little timidly, âwhy you are
âWouldnât it really?â said Alice in a tone of great surprise.
âYes!â shouted Alice.
âYes, I think youâd better leave off,â said the Gryphon: and Alice was
âYes, it _is_ his business!â said Five, âand Iâll tell himâit was for
âYes, we went to school in the sea, though you maynât believe itââ
âYes,â said Alice doubtfully: âit meansâtoâmakeâanythingâprettier.â
âYes,â said Alice, âIâve often seen them at dinnââ she checked herself
âYes,â said Alice, âwe learned French and music.â
âYou can really have no notion how delightful it will be
âYou canât think how glad I am to see you again, you dear old thing!â
âYou couldnât have wanted it much,â said Alice; âliving at the bottom
âYou did,â said the Mock Turtle.
âYou have baked me too brown, I must sugar my hair.â
âYou may not have lived much under the seaââ (âI havenât,â said
âYou ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple

â_Iâve_ been to a day-school, too,â said Alice; âyou neednât be so
â_That_ generally takes some time,â interrupted the Gryphon.
â_Youâd_ better not talk!â said Five. âI heard the Queen say only
